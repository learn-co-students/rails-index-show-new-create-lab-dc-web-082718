# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# # Examples:
# #
# Coupon.create(coupon_code: "123456", store: "Walgreens")
# Coupon.create(coupon_code: "ABCDEF", store: "CVS")
# Coupon.create(coupon_code: "x0x1x2", store: "Duane Reade")


#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
